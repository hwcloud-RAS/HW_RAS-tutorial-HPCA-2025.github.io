As cloud services become increasingly integral to modern computing, the reliability of underlying hardware components is
critical to maintaining service continuity and performance. This tutorial delves into the advanced methodologies for
predicting hardware failures to cloud service reliability.

We begin with an overview of hardware failures in data centers, followed by machine learning-based failure prediction
methods designed for different hardware components. Key topics include hardware metrics for predictive analysis, feature
engineering, algorithm selection, evaluation, and production deployment. In addition to knowledge share, the tutorial
offers a handson Memory Failure Prediction competition, where participants apply their techniques to real-world
problems. This tutorial is beneficial for researchers and engineers from both academia and industry, providing them with
useful tools and necessary knowledge to enhance hardware resilience and cloud service reliability.
